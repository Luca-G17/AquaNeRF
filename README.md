## Abstract
Novel view synthesis in underwater scenes presents many unexplored challenges, traditional NVS tech-
niques assume a static scene and that the medium in which the images were captured doesnâ€™t significantly
scatter or absorb light. The aim of this project is to deliver a system for generating an interactive 3D
representation of underwater scenes based on a dataset of static images. This system should be optimised
for delivering highly accurate novel views of a scene. Novel view synthesis has a wide range of real-world
applications including but not limited to: virtual-reality, allowing the user to navigate through a virtual
environment, 3D model generation and image/video editing such as scene relighting or viewpoint trans-
formation.

Crucially this project presents a rendering approach that leverages learned depth information to improve
its reconstruction accuracy. Additionally we implement several modifications to the MLP loss functions
proposed by existing work including a robust losses algorithm. Finally we add a post-processing step to
rectify reconstruction inaccuracies generated by the model
